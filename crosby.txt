To Whom It May Concern:

On the link below is a copy of the lawsuit that we filed against you in court on March 11, 2010.

Currently the Pretrail Conference is scheduled for April 10th, 2010 at 9:30 A.M. in courtroom #33.

The case number is 3485934. The reason the lawsuit was filed was due to a completely inadequate response from your company for copyright infrigement that our client Daughters of Columbus is a victim of Copyright infrigement:

Daughters of Columbus has proof of multiple Copyright Law violations that they wish to present in court on April 10th, 2010.
